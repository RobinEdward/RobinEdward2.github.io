    <h2>Andres Segovia</h2>
    <p>
      Andrés Segovia Torres,[a] 1st Marquis of Salobreña (21 February 1893 – 2
      June 1987) was a Spanish virtuoso classical guitarist. Many professional
      classical guitarists were either students of Segovia or students of
      Segovia's students.[1] Segovia's contribution to the modern-romantic
      repertoire included not only commissions but also his own transcriptions
      of classical or baroque works. He is remembered for his expressive
      performances: his wide palette of tone, and his distinctive musical
      personality, phrasing and style.Segovia was born on 21 February 1893[2] in
      Linares, Jaén. He was sent at a very young age to live with his uncle
      Eduardo and aunt María. Eduardo arranged for Segovia's first music lessons
      with a violin teacher after he had recognised that Segovia had an aptitude
      for music. That proved to be an unhappy introduction to music for the
      young Segovia because of the teacher's strict methods, and Eduardo stopped
      the lessons. His uncle decided to move to Granada to allow Segovia to
      obtain a better education. After arriving in Granada, Segovia recommenced
      his musical studies. Segovia was aware of flamenco during his formative
      years as a musician but stated that he "did not have a taste" for the form
      and chose instead the works of Fernando Sor, Francisco Tárrega, and other
      classical composers.[3] Tárrega agreed to give the self-taught Segovia
      some lessons but died before they could meet, and Segovia states that his
      early musical education involved the "double function of professor and
      pupil in the same body".[4] Career Segovia's first public performance was
      in Granada[5] at the age of 16 in 1909.[6] A few years later he played his
      first professional concert in Madrid, which included works by Francisco
      Tárrega and his own guitar transcriptions of Johann Sebastian Bach.
      Despite the discouragement of his family, who wanted him to become a
      lawyer, and criticism by some of Tárrega's pupils for his idiosyncratic
      technique,[7] he continued to pursue his studies of the guitar diligently.
      He played again in Madrid in 1912, at the Paris Conservatory in 1915 and
      in Barcelona in 1916 and made a successful tour of South America in
      1919.[2] Segovia's arrival on the international stage coincided with a
      time when the guitar's fortunes as a concert instrument were being
      revived, largely through the efforts of Miguel Llobet.[8] It was in that
      changing milieu that Segovia, thanks to his strength of personality and
      artistry, coupled with developments in recording and broadcasting,
      succeeded in making the guitar more popular again. In 1921 in Paris,
      Segovia met Alexandre Tansman, who later wrote a number of guitar works
      for Segovia, among them Cavatina, which won a prize at the Siena
      International Composition contest in 1952.[9] In 1921, he also met Agustín
      Barrios in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Segovia was impressed by Barrios'
      Bach-inspired and arguably magnum opus La Catedral.[10] At Granada in
      1922, he became associated with the Concurso de Cante Jondo, promoted by
      the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The aim of the "classicising"
      Concurso was to preserve flamenco in its purity from being distorted by
      modern popular music.[11] Segovia had already developed as a fine tocador
      of flamenco guitar, yet his direction was now classical.[12] Invited to
      open the Concurso held at the Alhambra, he played Homenaje a Debussy by
      Falla.[13] Guitar by Hermann Hauser, 1937, Munich, Germany. Concert guitar
      of Andrés Segovia's from 1937 until 1962. Gift of Emilita Segovia,
      Marquesa of Salobreña, 1986 (1986.353.1). Housed in the Metropolitan
      Museum of Art. In 1923, Segovia visited Mexico for the first time. There
      Manuel Ponce was so impressed with the concert that he wrote a review in
      El Universal.[14] Later Ponce went on to write many works for Segovia,
      including numerous sonatas. In 1924, Segovia, visited the German luthier
      Hermann Hauser Sr. after Segovia heard some of Hauser's instruments played
      in a concert in Munich. In 1928, Hauser provided Segovia with one of the
      guitars, which Segovia used during his tour of the United States and in
      other concerts up to 1933. Segovia ordered a further guitar from Hauser
      and after receiving it passed on the 1928 model to his American
      representative and close friend Sophocles Papas, who in his turn gave it
      to his student, the famous jazz and classical guitarist Charlie Byrd, who
      used it on several records. Segovia's first American tour was arranged in
      1928 when Fritz Kreisler, the Viennese violinist who privately played the
      guitar,[15] persuaded Francis Charles Coppicus from the Metropolitan
      Musical Bureau to present the guitarist in New York.[16][17] After
      Segovia's debut tour in the US in 1928 the Brazilian composer Heitor
      Villa-Lobos composed his now well-known Twelve Études (Portuguese: Doze
      estudos; French: Douze études; German: Zwölf Studien) and later dedicated
      them to Segovia. Their relationship proved to be lasting, and Villa-Lobos
      continued to write for Segovia. He also transcribed numerous classical
      pieces himself and revived the pieces transcribed by predecessors like
      Tárrega. Segovia at a recital in the "Concerts Ysaye" in Brussels, 15
      December 1932 (Hilda Wiener, 1877–1940) In 1932, Segovia met and
      befriended the composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco in Venice.[9] Since
      Castelnuovo-Tedesco did not play the guitar, Segovia provided him with
      guitar compositions (Ponce's Folias variations and Sor's Mozart
      Variations), which he could study. Castelnuovo-Tedesco composed a large
      number of works for the guitar, many of them dedicated to Segovia. The
      Concerto Op. 99 of 1939 was the first guitar concerto of the 20th century
      and Castelnuovo-Tedesco's last work in Italy, before he emigrated to the
      United States. It was premiered by Segovia in Uruguay in 1939.[18] In
      1935, he gave his first public performance of Bach's Chaconne, a difficult
      piece for any instrument. He moved to Montevideo and performed many
      concerts in South America in the 1930s and the early 1940s. After World
      War II, Segovia began to record more frequently and performed regular
      tours of Europe and America and would maintain that schedule for 30 years.
      In 1954, Joaquín Rodrigo dedicated Fantasía para un gentilhombre (Fantasy
      for a Gentleman) to Segovia.[19] Segovia won the 1958 Grammy Award for
      Best Classical Performance, Instrumentalist for his recording Segovia
      Golden Jubilee.[20] John W. Duarte dedicated his English Suite Op. 31 to
      Segovia and his wife, Emilia Magdalena del Corral Sancho, on the occasion
      of their marriage in 1962.[21] Segovia told the composer "You will be
      astonished at the success it will have".[22][23] In recognition of his
      contributions to music and the arts, Segovia was ennobled on 24 June 1981
      by King Juan Carlos I, who gave Segovia the hereditary title of Marqués de
      Salobreña[24][25] (English: Marquis of Salobreña) in the nobility of
      Spain. Segovia continued performing into his old age, and lived in
      semi-retirement during his seventies and eighties on the Costa del Sol.
      Two films were made of his life and work, one when he was 75 and the other
      when he was 84. They are available on DVD under the titles Andrés
      Segovia—in Portrait. His final RCA LP (ARL1-1602), Reveries, was recorded
      in Madrid in June 1977. In 1984, Segovia was the subject of a 13-part
      series broadcast on National Public Radio, Segovia! The series was
      recorded on location in Spain, France and the United States. Hosted by
      Oscar Brand, the series was produced by Jim Anderson, Robert Malesky and
      Larry Snitzler. Segovia died on 2 June 1987[2] in Madrid of a heart attack
      at the age of 94. He is buried at Casa Museo Andrés Segovia in Linares.
      Technique The right hand is responsible for the guitar's musical sound and
      so in examining the technique, the way the right hand is placed in
      relation to the strings is most important.[citation needed] For several
      years, it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the
      strings with a combination of fingertip and nail, as stated by Christopher
      Parkening[citation needed], but Segovia plucked the strings only with the
      nails. When asked which technique he used, he replied that it was "the
      only one there is: nails. Because they bring timbre differences and colour
      variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar."[26] His right hand was
      placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings. That way, the
      nail alone would press the string. At the same time, it was thought that
      was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings (E,
      A and D) of the guitar when they were plucked. Segovia created a strong
      bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique, largely because
      of the flexibility that he had in his thumb, which helped to create a very
      strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes. Another innovation that
      separated Segovia from the Tárrega school was the search for the tension
      in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side. That
      way, he could obtain colour variation but also an especially strong, round
      and voluminous sound, which was very helpful for giving concerts in big
      halls (the technique was later used by Narciso Yepes). Before Segovia,
      guitarists from the Tárrega school played the guitar with the hand right
      over the soundhole and thus created a mellow sound but could not fill the
      whole space of a large concert hall. After World War II, Segovia became
      among the first to endorse nylon strings, instead of catgut strings.[27]
      That advancement allowed for greater tonal stability and was the final
      ingredient in the standardization of the instrument. Repertoire Segovia's
      repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary
      works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for
      Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships,
      notably Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaquín Rodrigo, the
      Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario
      Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos;
      second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself,[28] of classical
      works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord,
      piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Albéniz, Enrique
      Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical
      guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco Tárrega.
      Segovia's influence enlarged the repertoire, mainly as a commissioner or
      dedicatee of new works, as a transcriber, and as a composer[29] with such
      works as his Estudio sin luz. Segovia in 1962 Segovia's main musical
      aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century (and turn of
      the century) especially in the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist
      style. That is perhaps best typified by Segovia's own work Estudio sin
      Luz. Many works of that and similar styles were written especially for him
      and formed part of his core repertoire: particularly the guitar works of
      Federico Moreno Torroba (1891–1982), such as the Sonatina, which was first
      performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925.[30] Segovia was selective and
      performed only works with which he identified personally. He was known to
      reject atonal works or those that he considered too radical even if they
      were dedicated to him; he rejected Frank Martin's Quatre pièces brèves,
      Darius Milhaud's Segoviana, etc.[31][32] Even though rejected by Segovia,
      all of those works are today published and
      available.[33][34][35][36][37][38] Teaching Segovia viewed teaching as
      vital to his mission of propagating the guitar and gave master classes
      throughout his career. His most famous master classes took place at Música
      en Compostela, in the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela.[39] Segovia
      also taught at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena for numerous
      years, where he was aided by Alirio Díaz.[40] His teaching style is a
      source of controversy among some of his former students, who considered it
      to be dogmatically authoritarian.[41] One of Segovia's most celebrated
      former students of the classical guitar, John Williams, has said that
      Segovia bullied students into playing only his style and stifled the
      development of their own styles.[42][43] Williams has also said that
      Segovia was dismissive of music that did not have what Segovia considered
      the correct classical origins, such as South American music with popular
      roots.[42] He was also critical of Williams' work with the group Sky for
      the same reasons. Legacy Segovia can be considered a catalytic figure in
      granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument
      capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation. Federico Moreno
      Torroba said, "The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is
      Andrés Segovia."[44] He can be credited to have dignified the classical
      guitar as a legitimate concert instrument before the discerning music
      public, which had hitherto viewed the guitar merely as a limited if
      sonorous parlour instrument. In Linares, the Segovia Museum "Fundación
      Andrés Segovia" was established in May 1995,[45] and Linares (Segovia's
      birthplace) also has a bronze statue in his honour, created by Julio López
      Hernández and unveiled on 25 May 1984.[46][47][48] Segovia influenced a
      generation of classical guitarists who built on his technique and musical
      sensibility, including Christopher Parkening, Julian Bream, John Williams
      and Oscar Ghiglia, all of whom have acknowledged their debt to him.
      Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and
      transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of
      Bach, particularly an extraordinarily-demanding classical guitar
      transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004).
      During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with
      Segovia, who suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as
      has been claimed. He once said, "All over the world I have 'pupils' I have
      never met."[49] His editions of works originally written for guitar
      include newly-fingered and occasionally-revised versions of works from the
      standard repertoire (most famously, his edition of a selection of twenty
      estudios by Fernando Sor,[50] the "cornerstone" of every serious student's
      technique since its publication in 1945 although somewhat ironically,
      Segovia, in the preface to that work, disparaged Sor as "not among the
      vigorous talents") as well as compositions written for him, including by
      Heitor Villa-Lobos, Federico Mompou, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.[51]
      Many of the latter had been edited by Segovia, working in collaboration
      with the composer, before they were first published. Because of Segovia's
      predilection for altering the musical content of his editions to reflect
      his interpretive preferences, many of today's guitarists prefer to examine
      the original manuscripts or newer publications based on the original
      manuscripts to compare them with Segovia's published versions to accept or
      reject Segovia's editorial decisions.[citation needed] Segovia was one of
      those to whom homage was paid in the 1978 song by Ian Dury and The
      Blockheads "There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards." Influential rock
      entertainer Johnny Thunders included a guitar instrumental titled
      "Illegitimate Son of Segovia" in his album Hurt me. Namings

    <h2>Augustin Barrios</h2>
    <p>
      Barrios was famed for his phenomenal performances, both live and on
      gramophone recordings. Eye-witness testimony from Lope Texera in Caracas
      Venezuela on April 18, 1932, declared that Barrios was "superior to
      Segovia whom I saw in London last year". Barrios has been credited as the
      first classical guitarist to make recordings, in 1909/10, but the earliest
      known recording were by guitarists Luis and Simon Ramirez, onto cylinders,
      for the "Viuda de Aramburo" label, in Madrid, between 1897 and 1901.[4]
      Barrios sometimes performed in concert in traditional Paraguayan dress (he
      was partly of Guaraní origin), beginning in 1932 using the pseudonym of
      Nitsuga Mangoré ('Nitsuga' being Agustín spelled backwards, and 'Mangoré'
      being the name of a cacique of the South American indigenous group
      Timbú).[citation needed] His works were largely late-Romantic in
      character, despite his having lived well into the twentieth century. Many
      of them are also adaptations of, or are influenced by, South American and
      Central American folk music. Many of them are considered virtuosic. The
      Johann Sebastian Bach-inspired La Catedral, from 1921, is widely
      considered to be Barrios' magnum opus, even winning the approval of Andrés
      Segovia, who said "In 1921 in Buenos Aires, I played at the hall La
      Argentina noted for its good acoustics for guitar, where Barrios had
      concertized just weeks before me. He was presented to me by his secretary
      Elbio Trapani. At my invitation Barrios visited me at the hotel and played
      for me upon my very own guitar several of his compositions among which the
      one that really impressed me was a magnificent concert piece The Cathedral
      whose first movement is an andante, like an introduction and prelude, and
      a second very virtuosic piece which is ideal for the repertory of any
      concert guitarist. Barrios had promised to send me immediately a copy of
      the work (I had ten days remaining before continuing my journey) but I
      never received a copy."[5] However, it is equally possible that Segovia
      did receive the score and chose not to play it, either out of distaste for
      Barrios' folk-based music or professional jealousy (because Barrios was
      more of a composer than he was). During his career, Barrios taught his
      patrons Luis Pasquet, Martin Borda Pagola, Dionisio Basualdo, Bautista and
      Lalyta Almiron, and Raul Borges. Following his extensive travels in
      Brazil, while he was an active performer and beginning in 1940, he wrote
      his guitar method to provide guitar instruction after arriving in El
      Salvador to selected students, mostly of Salvadoran nationality. They were
      known as the Twelve Mangoreanos: Luis Mario Samayoa ( -1969), Benjamín
      Cisneros ( -1987), Rubén Urquilla ( -1993), René Cortés-Andrino ( -1995),
      Mario Cardona Lazo ( -1999), Jesús Quiroa ( -2001), Jose Cándido Morales (
      -2002), Julio Cortés-Andrino ( -2006), Cecilio Orellana ( -2007), Roberto
      Bracamontes ( -2007), Víctor Urrutia ( -2010) and Elena Valdivieso. Jose
      Cándido Morales and Roberto Bracamonte were the only ones to learn from
      Barrios as live-in students in the Barrios home, which functioned as a
      boarding house. After Barrios' death, Morales remained the keeper of
      Barrios' legacy, technique and late works. The folk music of Paraguay
      (including the polca paraguaya and vals) provided the young Barrios with
      his first introduction to music. In 1898, Barrios was formally introduced
      to the classical guitar repertoire by Gustavo Sosa Escalada. At that time,
      Barrios may have already composed works for the guitar, and also performed
      pieces written by his other composers, such as La Chinita and La Perezosa.
      Under the influence of his new teacher, Barrios went on to perform and
      study the works of Tárrega, Viñas, Sor and Aguado. Sosa Escalada was so
      impressed with his new pupil that he convinced Barrios's parents to let
      him move to Asunción to continue his education. Having already surpassed
      the technical and performing abilities of most guitarists, Barrios began
      seriously to compose around 1905. Among the folkloric influences, Barrios
      is known to have played such popular Paraguayan works as "Campamento Cerro
      León", "Londón Carapé", "Guyrá campana", "Mamá Cumandá".[8] As an example,
      "Guyrá campana" is very interesting, since some of the material can be
      heard in parts of Barrios' recording of "Caazapá — Aire Popular
      Paraguayo". Though "Guyrá campana" is traditional music, many maintain
      that it is very closely related to guitarist Carlos Talavera (from
      Caazapá), whom Barrios knew.[9][10][11][12] There are various versions of
      "Guyrá campana" (it is also known as "Pájaro campana") e.g. for Paraguayan
      harp (Félix Pérez Cardozo[12]); in some versions, the birdsong imitations
      can be very clearly heard.[13]

    <h2>Liona Boyd</h2>
    <p>
      Liona Boyd was born in London and grew up in Toronto.[5] Her father grew
      up in Bilbao, Spain, and her mother in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Her
      grandmother was from Linares, Spain, the birthplace of the "king of the
      classical guitar", Andrés Segovia. During her family's first of two ocean
      voyages to Canada she made her debut performance playing "Bluebells of
      Scotland" on a treble recorder in a talent show on the ship. When she was
      thirteen, she was given her first guitar, a Christmas present which her
      parents had bought in Spain seven years earlier.[6] She took lessons from
      Eli Kassner, Narciso Yepes, Alirio Díaz, Julian Bream, and Andrés Segovia.
      Boyd received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Toronto in
      1972, graduating with honours. After graduation she studied privately for
      two years with Alexandre Lagoya in Paris. [5][7] Performing In 1975, she
      performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City.[5] Andrés Segovia sent her a
      note that said "through your beauty and talent you will conquer the
      public, philharmonic or not."[8] During the same year, she toured northern
      British Columbia and Yukon.[9] She also toured as the opening act for with
      Canadian folk singer Gordon Lightfoot.[5] Recordings In 1974, Boyd
      released her debut album, The Guitar. It was produced by Eleanor
      Koldofsky[10] and was released on Boot Records. The record was distributed
      internationally by London Records. In 1976, Boyd joined Society of
      Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, and established her own
      publishing company, Mid-Continental Music. In 1989, her album Christmas
      Dreams appeared on the RPM 100 Top Albums chart. To date she has three
      platinum and four gold albums in Canada.[11] As of 2018, she has recorded
      26 studio albums, made a live recording from Tokyo, created over 25 music
      videos, and produced three compilation recordings. During her career, Boyd
      has recorded with Chet Atkins, Eric Clapton, Al Di Meola, Rik Emmett,
      David Gilmour, Alex Lifeson, Steve Morse, the Canadian Brass, André
      Gagnon, Yo Yo Ma, Frank Mills, Strunz & Farah, Roger Whittaker, Gheorghe

    <h2>Narciso Yepes</h2>
    <p>
      Narciso Yepes was born into a family of humble origin in Lorca, Region of
      Murcia. His father gave him his first guitar when he was four years old,
      and took the boy five miles on a donkey to and from lessons three days a
      week. Yepes took his first lessons from Jesús Guevara, in Lorca. Later his
      family moved to Valencia when the Spanish Civil War started in 1936. When
      he was 13, he was accepted to study at the Conservatorio de Valencia with
      the pianist and composer Vicente Asencio. Here he followed courses in
      harmony, composition, and performance. Yepes is credited by many with
      developing the A-M-I technique of playing notes with the ring (Anular),
      middle (Medio), and index (Indice) fingers of the right hand.[2] Guitar
      teachers traditionally taught their students to play by alternating the
      index and middle fingers, or I-M. However, since Yepes studied under
      teachers who were not guitarists, they pushed him to expand on the
      traditional technique. According to Yepes, Asencio "was a pianist who
      loathed the guitar because a guitarist couldn't play scales very fast and
      very legato, as on a piano or a violin. 'If you can't play like that,' he
      told me, 'you must take up another instrument.'" Through practice and
      improvement in his technique, Yepes could match Asencio's piano scales on
      the guitar. "'So,' he [Asencio] said, 'it's possible on the guitar. Now
      play that fast in thirds, then in chromatic thirds.'"[3] Allan Kozinn
      observed that, "Thanks to Mr. Asencio's goading, Mr. Yepes learned "to
      play music the way I want, not the way the guitar wants."[4] Similarly,
      the composer, violinist, and pianist George Enescu would also push Yepes
      to improve his technique, which also allowed him to play with greater
      speed.[5] On 16 December 1947 he made his Madrid début, performing Joaquín
      Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez with Ataúlfo Argenta conducting the
      Spanish National Orchestra. The overwhelming success of this performance
      brought him renown from critics and public alike. Soon afterwards, he
      began to tour with Argenta, visiting Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and
      France. During this time he was largely responsible for the growing
      popularity of the Concierto de Aranjuez, and made two early recordings,
      both with Argenta[6] – one in mono with the Madrid Chamber Orchestra
      (released between 1953 and 1955),[7] and the second in stereo with the
      Orquesta Nacional de España (recorded in 1957 and released in 1959).[8] In
      1950, after performing in Paris, he spent a year studying interpretation
      under the violinist George Enescu, and the pianist Walter Gieseking. He
      also studied informally with Nadia Boulanger. This was followed by a long
      period in Italy where he profited from contact with artists of every
      kind.[citation needed] On 18 May 1951, as he leant on the parapet of a
      bridge in Paris and watched the Seine flow by, Yepes unexpectedly heard a
      voice inside him ask, "What are you doing?" He had been a nonbeliever for
      25 years, perfectly content that there was no God or transcendence or
      afterlife. But that existential question, which he understood as God's
      call, changed everything for him. He became a devout Catholic, which he
      remained for the rest of his life.[9] In 1952 a work ("Romance"), Yepes
      claims to have written when he was a young boy,[10] became the theme to
      the film Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits) by René Clément. Despite Yepes's
      claims of composing it, the piece ("Romance") has often been attributed to
      other authors; indeed published versions exist from before Yepes was even
      born, and the earliest known recording of the work dates from a cylinder
      from around 1900.[11][12][13] In the credits of the film Jeux Interdits,
      however, "Romance" is credited as "Traditional: arranged – Narciso Yepes."
      Yepes also performed other pieces for the Forbidden Games soundtrack. His
      later credits as film composer include the soundtracks to La Fille aux
      yeux d'or (1961) and La viuda del capitán Estrada (1991). He also starred
      as a musician in the 1967 film version of El amor brujo.

    <h2>Julian Bream</h2>
    <p>
      Julian Bream (15 July 1933 – 14 August 2020) was an English classical
      guitarist and lutenist.Regarded as one of the most distinguished classical
      guitarists of the 20th century, he played a significant role in improving
      the public perception of the classical guitar as a respectable instrument.
      Over the course of a career that spanned more than half a century, Bream
      also helped revive interest in the lute. After three and half years in the
      army, he took any musical jobs that came his way, including background
      music for radio plays and films.[6] Recording sessions and work for the
      BBC were important to Bream throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s.[6]
      He played part of a recital at the Wigmore Hall on the lute in 1952.[12]
      Bream pursued a busy career playing around the world. His first European
      tours took place in 1954 and 1955, followed (beginning in 1958) by
      extensive touring in the Far East, India, Australia, the Pacific Islands
      and many other parts of the world. His first North America tour was in
      1959.[13] 1960 saw the formation of the Julian Bream Consort, a
      period-instrument ensemble with Bream as lutenist.[5] The consort led a
      great revival of interest in the music of the Elizabethan era. In 1963,
      Bream performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston with the US
      debut of his Consort. In addition to master classes, Bream was a tutor of
      the music summer school at Dartington.[16][5] Later career In 1984, Bream
      seriously injured his right arm in a car accident. In 1991, BBC Radio and
      TV broadcast Bream's BBC Prom performance of Malcolm Arnold's Guitar
      Concerto.[17] He also participated in a recital and concerto performances
      of works by Toru Takemitsu at the Japan Festival in London with the London
      Symphony Orchestra. During the 1992–93 season he performed on two
      occasions at the Wigmore Hall – at their Gala Re-opening Festival, and at
      a special concert celebrating his 60th birthday. In the same period, he
      toured the Far East, visiting Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, and
      performed the premiere of Leo Brouwer's arrangement for guitar and
      orchestra of Albéniz's Iberia at the Proms. In 1994 Bream made debuts in
      both Turkey and Israel to great acclaim, and the following year played for
      the soundtrack to the Hollywood film Don Juan DeMarco.[18] In 1997, in
      celebration of the 50th anniversary of his debut, he performed a recital
      at Cheltenham Town Hall. A few weeks later, the BBC dedicated a television
      tribute This Is Your Life programme to Bream, filmed after a commemorative
      concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.[18][5] Other engagements
      around that time included a gala solo performance at the Philharmonic
      Hall, Liverpool; a Kosovo Aid concert at St. John's, Smith Square, London,
      with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; recitals at the Snape Proms,
      Aldeburgh, and at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival; and a tour of National
      Trust properties in summer and autumn 2000.[18] In November 2001 he gave
      an anniversary recital at Wigmore Hall, celebrating 50 years since his
      debut there in 1951.[18] His final recital was at Maddermarket Theatre,
      Norwich, on 6 May 2002.[11][6] Style and influences Bream's recitals were
      wide-ranging, including transcriptions from the 17th century, many pieces
      by Bach arranged for guitar, popular Spanish pieces, and contemporary
      music, for much of which he was the inspiration. He stated that he was
      influenced by the styles of Andrés Segovia and Francisco Tárrega.[19]
      Bream had some "sessions" with Segovia but did not actually study with
      him.[5] Segovia provided a personal endorsement and scholarship request to
      assist Bream in taking further formal music studies.[20] Bream's work
      showed that the guitar could be capably utilized in English, French, and
      German music.[6] Bream's playing can be characterised as virtuosic and
      highly expressive, with an eye for details, and with strong use of
      contrasting timbres. He did not consistently hold his right-hand fingers
      at right angles to the strings, but used a less rigid hand position for
      tonal variety.[21] Bream met Igor Stravinsky in Toronto, Canada, in 1965.
      He tried unsuccessfully to persuade the composer to write a composition
      for the lute and played a pavane by Dowland for him. The meeting between
      Bream and Stravinsky, including Bream's impromptu playing, was filmed by
      the National Film Board of Canada in making a documentary about the
      composer.[22] Recordings Bream recorded extensively for RCA Victor and EMI
      Classics. These recordings won him several awards, including four Grammy
      Awards, two for Best Chamber Music Performance and two for Best Classical
      Performance.[23] RCA also released The Ultimate Guitar Collection, a
      multi-CD set commemorating his birthday in 1993.[5][24] Despite his
      importance as a classical guitarist, however, many of his RCA recordings
      (including the series of 20th-century guitar music) were out of print for
      several years. In 2011, RCA released My Favorite Albums, a 10-CD set of
      albums chosen by Julian Bream himself.[25] In 2013, RCA issued Julian
      Bream: The Complete RCA Album Collection, a 40-CD set which also includes
      two DVDs with The Lively Arts – Julian Bream: A Life in the Country, the
      1976 BBC film; and four BBC shows: Omnibus: Anniversary of Sir William
      Walton [1982], The Julian Bream Consort (1961), Monitor – Film Profile of
      Julian Bream [1962], and The Julian Bream Consort (1964).[26] Television
      and video A film, A Life in the Country, was first shown on BBC TV in
      1976.[27] In it, the narrator and Bream discuss his beginnings and his
      life as a concert guitarist. Bream also presented a series of four
      master-classes for guitarists on BBC TV.[28] In 1984 he made eight film
      segments on location in Spain for Channel 4. The collection of segments
      ¡Guitarra! A Musical Journey Through Spain explored historical
      perspectives of Spanish guitar music.[29][30][31] The 2003 DVD video
      profile Julian Bream: My Life in Music contains three hours of interviews
      and performances. It has been declared by Graham Wade "the finest film
      contribution ever to the classic guitar" and it became "Gramophone DVD of
      the year".

    <img src="mauro_guiliano.jpeg" alt="A profile pic of Mauro Guiliani "></img>
    <h2>Mauro Guiliani</h2>
    <p>
      Mauro Giuseppe Sergio Pantaleo Giuliani (27 July 1781 – 8 May 1829) was an
      Italian guitarist, cellist, singer, and composer. He was a leading guitar
      virtuoso of the early 19th century. Giuliani defined a new role for the
      guitar in the context of European music. He was acquainted with the
      highest figures of Austrian society and with notable composers such as
      Rossini and Beethoven, and cooperated with the best active concert
      musicians in Vienna. In 1815 he appeared with Johann Nepomuk Hummel
      (followed later by Ignaz Moscheles), the violinist Joseph Mayseder and the
      cellist Joseph Merk, in a series of chamber concerts in the botanical
      gardens of Schönbrunn Palace, concerts that were called the "Dukaten
      Concerte",[2] after the price of the ticket, which was a ducat. This
      exposure gave Giuliani prominence in the musical environment of the city.
      Also in 1815, he was the official concert artist for the celebrations of
      the Congress of Vienna. Two years earlier, on 8 December 1813, he had
      played (probably cello) in an orchestra for the first performance of
      Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. In Vienna, Giuliani had minor success as a
      composer. He worked mostly with the publisher Artaria, who published many
      of his works for guitar, but had dealings with other local publishers who
      spread his compositions across Europe. He developed a teaching career here
      as well; among his numerous students were Jan Nepomucen Bobrowicz and
      Felix Horetzky. In 1819 Giuliani left Vienna, mainly for financial
      reasons: he expected to make financial profit on a concert tour through
      Bohemia and Bavaria. He returned to Italy, spending time in Trieste and
      Venice, and finally settled in Rome. In 1822 he brought his illegitimate
      daughter Emilia to Italy, who had been born in Vienna in 1813. She was
      educated at the nunnery L'adorazione del Gesù from 1821 to 1826, together
      with Giuliani's first illegitimate daughter Maria Willmuth. In Rome he had
      little success, publishing only a few compositions and giving only one
      concert. In July 1823 he began a series of trips to Naples to be with his
      father, who was seriously ill. In the Bourbon city of Naples, Giuliani
      would find a better reception to his guitar artistry, and was able to
      publish other works for guitar with local publishers. In 1826 he performed
      in Portici before Francesco I and the Bourbon court. During this
      Neapolitan period, he appeared frequently in duo concert with his daughter
      Emilia, who had become a skilled performer on the guitar. Toward the end
      of 1827 his health began to fail; and he died in Naples on 8 May 1829.

    <h2>Ana Vidovic</h2>
    <p>
      Her international career includes frequent recitals, concerto engagements,
      festival appearances, and tours all over the world. Vidović has performed
      with numerous orchestras. She often plays works by Johann Sebastian Bach,
      who is her favorite composer, and other composers such as Federico Moreno
      Torroba, Manuel Ponce, Francisco Tárrega, and Joaquín Rodrigo (including
      Concierto de Aranjuez).[3][5][1] Ana Vidović has won over twenty awards at
      international competitions, in which she participated until she was 18
      years old.[1] Her accolades include first prizes in the Albert Augustine
      Memorial International Competition (Bath, England) at the age of 13, the
      Fernando Sor competition (Rome, Italy), and the Francisco Tárrega
      competition (Benicàssim, Spain). Other top prizes include the Eurovision
      Young Musicians competition, the Mauro Giuliani competition in Italy, the
      Printemps de la Guitare competition in Belgium, and the Young Concert
      Artists International Auditions in New York.[6][5][7] In a review of one
      of her performances in 2006, Stephen Brookes of The Washington Post wrote:
      "her playing [...] was virtually immaculate – detailed, precise and
      polished. But this was no mere virtuosic display. Vidovic's playing is
      nuanced and intensely personal, both deeply felt and deeply thought."[8]
      Guitar Review's Stephen Griesgraber noted "It is difficult to know where
      to begin when discussing the enormous talents of Ana Vidovic. Her dynamic
      range, beauty of sound, precision of articulation and virtuosity are such
      that listening becomes more of an absolute musical experience."[9] She
      cites Paco de Lucía as a role model, John Williams as a significant
      musical inspiration, along with many other composers and musicians. She
      mentioned Jacqueline du Pré's performance of the Elgar Concerto as one of
      her favorite classical CDs. Vidović plays a Jim Redgate guitar exclusively
      and said, "[Several] years ago, I tried a Redgate [...] and felt an
      immediate connection [...]. This is a very special instrument that you
      could explore for many years."[1] She has released six CDs, two live DVDs,
      and has been featured on compilation albums. Guitar Virtuoso (2006) DVD is
      a performance of works by Bach, Torroba, Paganini, and Walton; while on
      Guitar Artistry in Concert (2009), she performs the music of Torroba,
      Piazzolla, Pierre Bensusan, Sérgio Assad, Stanley Myers, Villa-Lobos, and
      Barrios.[10]

    <img src="Francisco_Tárrega_full.jpg" alt="A profile pic of Francisco Tarrega "></img>
    <h2>Francisco Tarrega</h2>
    <p>
      Francisco de Asís Tárrega y Eixea (21 November 1852 – 15 December 1909)
      was a Spanish composer and classical guitarist of the late Romantic
      period.[1] He is known for such pieces as Capricho Árabe and Recuerdos de
      la Alhambra. In 1862, concert guitarist Julián Arcas, on tour in
      Castellón, heard the young Tárrega play and advised Tárrega's father to
      allow Francisco to come to Barcelona to study with him. Tárrega's father
      agreed, but insisted that his son take piano lessons as well. The guitar
      was viewed as an instrument to accompany singers, while the piano was
      quite popular throughout Europe. However, Tárrega had to stop his lessons
      shortly after, when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although Tárrega
      was only ten years old, he ran away and tried to start a musical career on
      his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was
      soon found and brought back to his father, who had to make great
      sacrifices to advance his son's musical education. Three years later, in
      1865, he ran away again, this time to Valencia where he joined a Romani
      family. His father looked for him and brought him back home once more, but
      he ran away a third time, again to Valencia. By his early teens, Tárrega
      was proficient on both the piano and the guitar. For a time, he played
      with other musicians at local engagements to earn money, but eventually he
      returned home to help his family. Tárrega entered the Madrid Royal
      Conservatory in 1874, under the sponsorship of a wealthy merchant named
      Antonio Canesa. He had brought along with him a recently purchased guitar,
      made in Seville by Antonio de Torres. Its superior sonic qualities
      inspired him both in his playing and in his view of the instrument's
      compositional potential. At the conservatory, Tárrega studied composition
      under Emilio Arrieta who convinced him to focus on guitar and abandon the
      idea of a career with the piano. By the end of the 1870s, Tárrega was
      teaching the guitar (Emilio Pujol, Miguel Llobet, and Daniel Fortea were
      pupils of his) and giving regular concerts. Tárrega received much acclaim
      for his playing and began traveling to other areas of Spain to perform. By
      this time he was composing his first works for guitar, which he played in
      addition to works of other composers. During the winter of 1880, Tárrega
      replaced his friend Luis de Soria, in a concert in Novelda, Alicante,
      where, after the concert, an important man in town asked the artist to
      listen to his daughter, María José Rizo, who was learning to play guitar.
      Soon they were engaged. In 1881, Tárrega played in the Opera Theatre in
      Lyon and then the Paris Odeon, in the bicentenary of the death of Pedro
      Calderón de la Barca. He also played in London, where he liked neither the
      language nor the weather. There is a story about his visit to England:
      after a concert, some people saw that the musician was in low spirits.
      "What is the matter, maestro?" they asked him. "Do you miss home? Your
      family, perhaps?" They advised him to capture that moment of sadness in
      his music. Thus he conceived the theme of one of his most memorable works,
      Lágrima (teardrop). After playing in London he returned to Novelda for his
      wedding. At Christmas 1882, Tárrega married María José Rizo. To enlarge
      his guitar repertory and to make use of his considerable knowledge of
      keyboard music, he soon began transcribing piano works of Beethoven,
      Chopin, Mendelssohn and others. Tárrega and his wife moved to Madrid,
      gaining their living by teaching privately and playing concerts, but after
      the death of an infant daughter during the winter, Maria Josefa de los
      Angeles Tárrega Rizo, they settled permanently in Barcelona in 1885. Among
      his friends in Barcelona were Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, Joaquín
      Turina and Pau Casals. (Left): Portrait by Vicente Castell (1904);
      (right): Monument to Tarrega in Castellón, Spain Francisco Tárrega and
      María José (María Josefa) Rizo had three more children: Paquito
      (Francisco), Maria Rosatia (María Rosalia) (best known as Marieta) and
      Concepción. On a concert tour in Valencia shortly afterward, Tárrega met
      the wealthy Concepción Gómez de Jacoby, who became a valuable patron to
      him. She allowed him and his family use of part of her house outside
      Barcelona. Later she took him to Granada, which later inspired the
      guitarist to write Recuerdos de la Alhambra, which he first dedicated to
      Concepción in 1899 with the title "A Granada." He later dedicated a
      revised published version of this piece to Alfred Cottin, the French
      guitarist he had met in Paris while participating in a concert on a visit
      accompanied and almost certainly sponsored by Gómez de Jacoby. From the
      later 1880s up to 1903, Tárrega continued composing and traveling, but
      limited his concerts to Spain. In 1900, Tárrega visited Algiers, where he
      was said to have heard a repetitive rhythm played on an Arabian drum and
      the following morning composed Danza Mora based on that rhythm. In about
      1902, he cut his fingernails and created a sound that would become typical
      of those guitarists later associated with his school. The following year
      he went on tour to Italy, performing in Rome, Naples, and Milan. In
      January 1906, he was afflicted with paralysis on his right side, and
      though he would eventually return to performing, he never completely
      recovered. He finished his last work, Oremus, on 2 December 1909. He died
      in Barcelona thirteen days later, on 15 December, at the age of 57.

      See media help. Tárrega composed music in the romantic style of
      19th-century European masters. His conservatory training and familiarity
      with contemporary classical genres and techniques are apparent in his
      compositions and transcriptions; these are more sophisticated than those
      of Spanish guitarist-composers of the previous generation and his
      contemporaries, e.g., Magín Alegre, Tomás Damas, Julián Arcas, José Viñas,
      and José Ferrer. A virtuoso on his instrument, he was known as the
      "Sarasate of the guitar," although Tárrega preferred small intimate
      performances over the concert stage. Tárrega is considered to have laid
      the foundations for 20th-century classical guitar and for increasing
      interest in the guitar as a recital instrument. Compositions See also:
      List of compositions by Francisco Tárrega Sheet music of Tárrega
      compositions Although only 19 original compositions were published in his
      lifetime, Francisco Tárrega composed approximately 80 original pieces and
      120 transcriptions – mostly for his own use and that of his students. Most
      of his later published works were edited by others, and often altered. His
      favored genres were character pieces (several with Spanish, Moorish and
      Arabic allusions) including preludes, etudes, caprices, serenades, and
      dances. He transcribed many works from the piano (he was a capable
      keyboard player), violin and the operatic repertory. As with several of
      his Spanish contemporaries, such as his friend Isaac Albéniz, he had an
      interest in combining the prevailing romantic style in classical music
      with Spanish folk elements, and transcribed several of Albéniz's piano
      pieces. He is also the composer of Gran Vals, an excerpt of which was used
      in the Nokia tune, the default ringtone of Nokia phones. It appears on
      these phones in a variety of different styles and instrumentations; for
      example, phones from 2002 to 2007 include piano-based renditions, while
      phones released during 2008 to 2010 feature a folk-inspired guitar
      rendition. In 2015, the Italian violist Marco Misciagna published his
      arrangements for solo viola of the Tango, Capricho árabe and Recuerdos de
      la Alhambra.

    <h2>Christopher Parkening</h2>
    <p>
      Christopher Parkening was born in Los Angeles, California. His cousin Jack
      Marshall, a studio musician active in the 1960s, introduced Parkening to
      the recordings of Andrés Segovia when he was 11 and encouraged his
      classical guitar studies. By the age of 19 he had embarked on a
      professional career of regular touring and recording.[1] Segovia has
      stated that, "Christopher Parkening is a great artist—-he is one of the
      most brilliant guitarists in the world."[1][2] The Washington Post stated,
      Christopher Parkening is “the leading guitar virtuoso of our day,
      combining profound musical insight with complete technical mastery of his
      instrument.” At age 30, Parkening withdrew from public performances and
      recording seeking a respite from the demands of a professional career and
      a chance to pursue his hobby of flyfishing. During this period Parkening
      rarely played guitar choosing instead to focus his attention on his
      Montana ranch and trout stream. While visiting his Southern California
      home in winter, a neighbor invited Parkening to the Grace Community
      Church. Profoundly affected by this experience Parkening[3] returned to
      recording and performing with a renewed sense of purpose" to glorify God
      with his music. He then released Simple Gifts, an album of traditional
      Christian hymns arranged for classical guitar. His autobiography Grace
      Like a River was published in 2006.[4] Star in honor of Parkening, on the
      sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana Parkening has
      recorded over 20 albums for Angel and EMI Classics. He has been nominated
      twice for a Grammy Award. Notable recordings include Parkening Plays
      Vivaldi featuring a selection of Baroque concertos, Pleasures of Their
      Company with soprano Kathleen Battle, produced by Patti Laursen and
      nominated for the 1986 Classical Record of the Year Grammy Award as well
      as the world premiere recording of Peter Warlock's Capriol Suite with the
      Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[5] As an educator, Parkening has been
      instrumental in cementing the guitar's reputation and esteem within
      academia. He created the guitar department at the University of Southern
      California in 1969, when he was only 22, and he was serving as the head of
      the department when he first retired from public performance at age 30.[6]
      During his famous sabbatical from the guitar, spent mostly fly-fishing in
      Montana, he agreed to found a guitar department at Montana State
      University, and he did what he terms a "token" amount of teaching at MSU
      during this time.[6] He was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Music from
      Montana State University in 1983.[7] He is currently Distinguished
      Professor of Music and Chair in Classical Guitar at Pepperdine University,
      where, in addition to his work with guitar majors, he also teaches a
      public master class. In a 2013 interview, Parkening said that he is
      retired from the concert stage and is focused on his family and
      teaching.[8]
